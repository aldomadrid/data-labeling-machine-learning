# data-labeling-machine-learning
This project was created to facilitate the cropping of images for SVM training. 

First, MATLAB is first used to convert a video into images. Then, the small program written in C++ allows the user to select ROIs over objects of interest, classified as positive ROIs, and those not of interest, classified as negative ROIs.

To select a positive ROI use the left button of your mouse. To select a negative ROI use the right button of your mouse. Press space for options. 


This program was constructed using boost c++ libraries and opencv 2.4.13.
