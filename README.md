# data-labeling-machine-learning
This project was created to facilitate the cropping of images for SVM training. MATLAB is first used to convert a video into images. A small program created in c++ is then used to crop and store selected ROIs as positive and negative images.  

Work under progress: 
  The C++ program will be able to store cropped out images into corresponding folders and to train an SVM with opencv.
