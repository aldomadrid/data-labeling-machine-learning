# data-labeling-machine-learning
This project was created to facilitate the cropping of images for SVM training. MATLAB is first used to convert a video into images. A small program created in C++ will then be used to crop and store selected ROIs as positive and negative images.  

Work under progress: 
  The C++ program will be able to train an SVM as soon as 10 positives and 10 negatives are selected from images. The 
  progam will also test the classifier on an image and ask you if you want to continue labeling data. 
  This program can currently save all the selected ROIs in a folder, resize, and label them as negatives or positives.
